# nyquist_vs_sparse_sampling
# Objective:
# To simulate the sampling of continuous-time signals using Python, and visually demonstrate
# the principles of Nyquist sampling and the consequences of undersampling (aliasing) when the 
# Nyquist criterion is violated.
# Background:
# The Nyquist-Shannon Sampling Theorem states that a continuous-time signal can be perfectly
#  reconstructed from its samples if it is band-limited and sampled at a rate at least twice 
# its maximum frequency (the Nyquist Rate). When this condition is not met, aliasing occurs â€” 
# different frequency components become indistinguishable, resulting in signal distortion.
# Tasks:
# Generate a set of continuous-time sinusoidal signals of varying frequencies.
# Sample these signals at different sampling rates:
# Above the Nyquist rate (safe)
# Exactly at the Nyquist rate (edge case)
# Below the Nyquist rate (undersampling)
# Reconstruct the signals using interpolation and compare with the original.
# Plot time-domain and frequency-domain views to visually explain aliasing.
# Expected Outcomes:
# Clear visualizations of the original and sampled signals.
# Frequency-domain plots showing how aliasing folds frequencies into incorrect locations.
# Intuition on how sampling rate affects signal integrity.
# ðŸ“Š Bonus:
# Add sliders or interactive plots (e.g., using ipywidgets or matplotlib) to dynamically change 
# frequency and sampling rate for live aliasing demonstration.
